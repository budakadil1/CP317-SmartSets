To set up and run the project:

1. Python 3.12.3 must be used. Some older versions may be fine but some dependencies may not work so please make sure 
3.12.3 is installed.

2. Make a python virtual environment by running:
python -m venv venv
or
python3 -m venv venv

3. Activate python virtual environment by:
Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate.bat (if using cmd) 
venv\Scripts\activate.ps1 (if using powershell)
Linux/Mac (bash):
source venv/bin/activate

4. Make sure all requirements are installed by running:
pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt

5. Now navigate to the SmartSets directory on your shell application by using:
